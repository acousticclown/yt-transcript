# YT-Transcript

## What this is

YT-Transcript is a personal-first, open-source web application that transforms YouTube videos into clean transcripts, structured notes, and editable summaries.

The focus is on clarity, playfulness, and practical utility—not AI hype or unnecessary complexity.

## What problem it solves

- **Long videos are hard to revisit** - Finding specific information in hour-long videos is tedious
- **Notes are scattered** - Important insights get lost across different tools and platforms
- **Existing tools are rigid or expensive** - Most solutions either lock you into a workflow or cost money
- **Multilingual Indian context is ignored** - Hinglish and Hindi support is rare in existing tools

## What it intentionally does NOT do

- No social network features
- No recommendation engine
- No aggressive monetization strategies
- No "magic" without transparency and control

## Target users

- **Me** (primary daily user)
- Developers who consume technical content
- Students learning from video courses
- Knowledge workers who need to extract insights quickly
- Open-source contributors who want to understand and improve the tool

## Core principles

- **Incremental build** - Build day by day, feature by feature, not all at once
- **Replaceable AI providers** - Don't lock into a single AI service; keep it swappable
- **Simple > clever** - Prefer straightforward solutions over clever abstractions
- **Playful, not noisy** - Delightful UX that doesn't distract from the core task
